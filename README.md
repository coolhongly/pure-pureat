# Pureat - I tell you where to eat, just eat.

This is a hackathon project by Hongli.Yin. I plan to make a command line tool that randomly picks a
restaurant based on the eating schedule set by the user. If the user does not specify a category,
the system will ramdomly picks a restaurant.
This application is built on Yelp search API.
